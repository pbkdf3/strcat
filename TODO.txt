* offsets (output/seek/etc)
* keys (input and output)
* argument to set exit timeout (-x 1000 default, -x 0 never?)
* rate limiting with a token bucket - messages/sec and bytes/sec. but which token bucket
  maybe extract https://github.com/wolkykim/qlibc/blob/master/src/extensions/qtokenbucket.c from qlibc?
* consider how cursors/offsets are managed, for fun. maybe commit after write to stdout?
* non text based use cases - eol behavior etc. avro, others? if c-library exists ...
* check out kafkacat for anything to steal, consider if forking for mapr streams worthwhile
* oh yeah, tests
